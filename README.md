# Welcome!
Hello, world! I've decided to learn the GSC language for **T6**. So far, I've written a couple features; of which you will see down below in [Features](https://github.com/lattemango/gsc-scripts#Features). I hope you have fun using and modifying my scripts (as you can under the [License](https://github.com/lattemango/gsc-scripts/blob/main/LICENSE)! If you have any issues or concerns using my scripts, please let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/lattemango/gsc-scripts/issues) section!

## Features
Down below I have the features I've currently developed. Watch the commits for more, if I find myself adding more.
 - [x] Chat Commands
 - [x] Database System (JSON)
 - [x] Banking System (utilising the database)
 - [x] Rankup System (utilising the database)
 - [x] Discord Webhook Support
 - [x] HTTP POST Request Support (utilising my [t6-gsc-utils fork](https://github.com/lattemango/t6-gsc-utils/))

More to come soon (if people want it)!
