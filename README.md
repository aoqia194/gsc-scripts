# Welcome!
Hello, world! I've decided to learn the GSC language for **T6**. So far, I've written a couple features; of which you will see down below in [Features](https://github.com/lattemango/gsc-scripts#features). I hope you have fun using and modifying my scripts (as you can under the [License](https://github.com/lattemango/gsc-scripts/blob/main/LICENSE)! If you have any issues or concerns using my scripts, please let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/lattemango/gsc-scripts/issues) section!

## Features
Down below I have the features I've currently developed. Watch the commits for more, if I find myself adding more.
 - [x] Chat Commands
 - [x] Database System (JSON)
 - [x] Banking System (utilising the database)
 - [x] Rankup System (utilising the database)
 - [x] Discord Webhook Support
 - [x] HTTP POST Request Support (utilising my [t6-gsc-utils fork](https://github.com/lattemango/t6-gsc-utils/))

More to come soon (if people want it)!

## Installation
The installation for scripts is actually **really easy**.
1. Download the [source files](https://github.com/lattemango/gsc-scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Download `t6-gsc-utils.dll` from my [t6-gsc-utils fork](https://github.com/lattemango/t6-gsc-utils/releases/latest/)
3. Find where you downloaded the source files and extract them by right-clicking the file and selecting `Extract All`
4. Go into the folder that was just extracted and drag the scripts folder into this directory: `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6`
5. In the folder you dragged the folder to (known as the T6 game storage), make a new folder called `plugins`.
6. Navigate to where you downloaded `t6-gsc-utils.dll`
7. Drop `t6-gsc-utils.dll` into the newly created `plugins` folder.
8. Your T6 game storage should look like this: 		![The T6 storage folder](https://i.imgur.com/F9YO59O.png)
You might not have some files or folders like mine, but all that matters is you have the `plugins` and `scripts` folder. Make sure to check inside the scripts folder for my name `lattemango`. If it's in there, you can be sure that you installed it correctly!
